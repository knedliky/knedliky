## Hello! I'm Simon 👨🏽‍💻

### About me 📚
I am currently in the final stretch of a Master of Data Science degree at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. My prior education was in International Relations, where I completed a Bachelor of Arts and Diploma of Languages (Spanish). To finish the degree, I submitted a a mini-thesis on the topic of migration, while living and teaching in Spain. 

My interest in Data Science piqued at the completion of my undergraduate years, when I came to the realisation that a multidisplinary background has value in a tech. After realising that I could use my aptitude for tech to pursue a career in the industry, I began to make the transition from Social Science into Computer Science. I taught myself prequisite concepts of Computer Science including coding and mathematics and found an alternate pathway into my current course.

I'm finding AI Ethics an interesting area that my studies have taken me, it seems like a relatively under-represented subcategory of Data Science and it is an area where my strengths in Liberal Arts might be best utilised. In saying this, I have a lot of fun with Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning - where I find nothing more satisfying than solving a complicated problem.

### Projects 🧰
I'm currently in the process of migrating projects that I've completed over the years to this page, so please bear with me while this happens! I'm hoping that during this process, I'll also get a chance to revisit these projects and make improvements along the way. I started off coding in Java, however, have transitioned into Data Science lanauges - R and mainly Python during the later parts of my current degree.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, queries or comments!
