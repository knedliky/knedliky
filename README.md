## 👨🏽‍💻 Hello! I'm Simon

### 📚 About me 
I am currently in the final stretch of a Master of Data Science degree at RMIT University in Melbourne. My prior education was in International Relations, where I completed a Bachelor of Arts and Diploma of Languages (Spanish). To finish the degree, I submitted a a mini-thesis on the topic of migration, while living  and working in the south of Spain. 

My interest in Data Science piqued at the completion of my undergraduate years, when I came to the realisation that a multidisplinary background has value in a tech. After realising that I could use my interest and aptitude for tech to pursue a career in the industry, I began to make the transition into Computer Science. I taught myself prequisite concepts of Computer Science including programming and mathematics and through doing so found an alternate pathway into my current course.

I'm finding AI Ethics an interesting area that my studies have taken me, it seems like a relatively under-represented subdomain of Data Science and it is an area where my strengths and skills in my previous studies could be utilised. In saying this, I thorouoghly enjoy Analytics and Machine Learning, where I find nothing more satisfying than finding a solution to an interesting problem.

### 🧰 Projects 
I'm currently in the process of familiarising myself with git, and migrating projects that I've completed over the years to GitHub, so please bear with me while this happens! I'm hoping that during this process, I'll also get a chance to revisit these projects and make improvements along the way. 

I started coding in Java, however, have transitioned into Data Science lanauges - SAS, SQL, R, Scala with most of my focus on Python during the later parts of my current degree.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, queries or comments!
