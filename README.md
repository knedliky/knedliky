Hello! I'm Simon 👨🏽‍💻

### About me 📚
I am currently in the final stretch of a Master of Data Science degree at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. My prior education was in International Relations and Spanish, where I completed a Bachelor's degree and Diploma of Languages (Spanish). To finish the previous degree, I submitted a a mini-thesis on the topic of migration, while living and teaching in Spain. 

At the moment, I'm working for a Business Intelligence platform. 

My interest in Data Science piqued at the completion of my undergraduate years, when I came to the realisation that a multidisplinary background has value in a technical industry. After having doubted my ability to make the transition from Social Science into Computer Science, I taught myself prequisite concepts of Computer Science including coding and mathematics and found a pathway into my current degree.

I'm finding AI Ethics an interesting area that my studies have taken me, it seems like a relatively under-represented subcategory of Data Science where my strengths may be best utilised, however, I'm also having fun with Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

### Projects 🧰
I'm currently in the process of migrating projects that I've completed over the years to this page, so please bear with me while this happens! I'm hoping that during this process, I'll also get a chance to revisit these projects and make improvements along the way. I started off coding in Java, however, have transitioned into Data Science lanauges - R and mainly Python during the later parts of my current degree.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, queries or comments!
